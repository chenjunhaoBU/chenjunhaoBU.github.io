* I studied how donors respond to merit and need when giving to families facing unaffordable medical expenses.
* With data from a leading crowdfunding platform in China, I find that campaigns receive more donations if patients or fundraisers report attending (prestigious) colleges.
* At the transaction level, a serial donor favors patients who attend a higher-ranked college or have a higher education level.
* To control for campaign and writing characteristics, novel NLP techniques are employed to extract information from fundraising text
* An online survey experiment is conducted to elicit respondents’ willingness to donate to synthetic fundraising stories, in which the patients’ college and medical expenses are independently randomized. Both academic merit and financial need enhance donor generosity.
* In line with limited knowledge of college ranking, the effect on college rankings is more pronounced for top and in-province institutions.
* Merit help attract more donation, probably by amplifying the warm glow effect.

This paper studies how donors respond to merit and need when giving to families facing unaffordable medical expenses. With data from a
leading crowdfunding platform in China, I find that campaigns receive more donations if patients or fundraisers report attending (prestigious) colleges. After controlling for story content, textual characteristics, and tie strength, I show that, at the transaction level, a serial donor favors patients who attend a higher-ranked college or have a higher education level. An online survey experiment is conducted to elicit respondents’ willingness to donate to synthetic fundraising stories, in which the patients’ college and medical expenses are independently randomized. Both academic merit and financial need enhance donor generosity. In line with limited knowledge of college ranking, the effect on college rankings is more pronounced for top and in-province institutions. Merit help attract more donation, probably by amplifying the warm glow effect.

* Collected a large dataset of official (red-header) documents in China
* Identified policies from document topics classified by BERT
* Depicted the patterns of policy creation and diffusion
* Associated the patterns with regional development characteristics and promotion incentives of local leaders
