This paper studies how donors respond to merit and need when giving to families facing unaffordable medical expenses. With data from a leading crowdfunding platform in China, I find that campaigns receive more donations if patients or fundraisers report attending (selective) colleges. At the transaction level, I show that, after controlling for campaign characteristics and donor fixed effect, a repeat donor favors patients who attend a higher-ranked college or have a higher education level. An online survey experiment is conducted to elicit respondents’ willingness to donate to synthetic fundraising stories, in which the patients’ college and medical expenses are independently randomized. Both academic merit and financial need enhance donor generosity. The effect on college ranking is more pronounced for top and in-province institutions and among respondents with better knowledge of college ranking. Merit helps attract more donations, likely by enhancing perceived deservingness. Novel textual methods based on large language models are developed to extract information and build measures from text efficiently.

Using large language models to categorize policy documents and exploiting a unique social networking setup among policymakers at China’s Party School, we investigate the diffusion of policy ideas. The study finds that policy diffusion is more likely between cities with leaders who were classmates in these training programs. The results indicate that social networks significantly influence policy transmission. The impact of these social connections is equivalent to approximately 10% of the effect of directly moving a policymaker from one jurisdiction to another. These findings primarily apply to non-economic policies, suggesting that when tackling complex social problems, policymakers rely on knowledge exchange with more experienced peers in their network.

## Born to lead: Ballot Order Effect without (Open) Election
___
I documented that Chinese officials with fewer strokes in the family name, and thus with the name appearing early in a roster, are overrepresented at the top leadership body(central committee). The overrepresentation relative to the population (and to the top scientists) is largely driven by names with the fewest 24% strokes (≤ 6 strokes) and is more pronounced for names with fewer strokes. A minor effect is found for less powerful members of the NPC and CPPCC. This roster effect suggests limited attention of officials in charge of appointment or involved in the party's personnel selection process. The advantage of name order in politicians' career advancement is not unique to public elections and has a non-trivial effect on who becomes top leaders.
